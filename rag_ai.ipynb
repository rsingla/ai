       "AIMessage(content=\"Building a complete rules engine in Kotlin using an open-source rule engine like Drools or Easy Rules can be a complex task, but I can provide you with a high-level overview of the process:\\n\\n1. Define your rules: Start by defining the rules that your rules engine will need to evaluate. These rules can be expressed in a domain-specific language or in a more general-purpose format like JSON or XML.\\n\\n2. Set up the rule engine: Choose an open-source rule engine like Drools or Easy Rules and add the necessary dependencies to your Kotlin project. You can find instructions for setting up these rule engines on their respective websites or documentation.\\n\\n3. Create the rule engine configuration: Configure the rule engine with the necessary settings and options, such as defining the rule execution order, specifying rule priorities, and setting up any custom rule evaluators or listeners.\\n\\n4. Implement your rules: Write the actual rule logic in Kotlin code, using the rule engine's API to define the conditions and actions that should be taken when a rule is triggered.\\n\\n5. Test your rules: Create test cases to ensure that your rules are working correctly and producing the expected results. You can use tools like JUnit or KotlinTest to automate the testing process.\\n\\n6. Integrate the rules engine into your application: Finally, integrate the rules engine into your Kotlin application by invoking the rule engine's API to evaluate rules based on your application's data and logic.\\n\\nThis is just a high-level overview of the process, and building a complete rules engine can involve many more steps and considerations depending on the complexity of your rules and the requirements of your application. I recommend consulting the documentation and resources provided by the specific rule engine you choose to use for more detailed guidance on building a rules engine in Kotlin.\", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 353, 'prompt_tokens': 29, 'total_tokens': 382}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3bc1b5746c', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})"
