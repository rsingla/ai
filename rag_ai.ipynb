       "AIMessage(content='Sure! Here is a step-by-step guide on how to build a complete rules engine in Kotlin using an open-source rule engine called Drools:\\n\\n1. Add Drools dependency to your project: Add the following dependency to your build.gradle file:\\n\\n```\\ndependencies {\\n    implementation \\'org.kie:kie-api:7.59.0.Final\\'\\n    implementation \\'org.drools:drools-core:7.59.0.Final\\'\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. Create a rule file: Create a rules file in src/main/resources directory. For example, create a file called rules.drl and add some rules to it. Here is an example rule:\\n\\n```\\nrule \"Example Rule\"\\nwhen\\n    $person: Person(age < 18)\\nthen\\n    $person.setCanVote(false);\\nend\\n```\\n\\n3. Create a model class: Create a model class for the objects that your rules will operate on. Here is an example model class:\\n\\n```\\ndata class Person(var age: Int, var canVote: Boolean = true)\\n```\\n\\n4. Create a RulesEngine class: Create a class called RulesEngine that will be responsible for loading and executing the rules. Here is an example RulesEngine class:\\n\\n```\\nimport org.kie.api.KieServices\\nimport org.kie.api.runtime.KieContainer\\nimport org.kie.api.runtime.KieSession\\n\\nclass RulesEngine {\\n    private val kieContainer: KieContainer = KieServices.Factory.get().newKieClasspathContainer()\\n\\n    fun executeRules(person: Person) {\\n        val kieSession: KieSession = kieContainer.newKieSession()\\n        kieSession.insert(person)\\n        kieSession.fireAllRules()\\n        kieSession.dispose()\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n5. Execute the rules: Create an instance of the RulesEngine class and call the executeRules method with a Person object to execute the rules. Here is an example usage:\\n\\n```\\nfun main() {\\n    val person = Person(16)\\n    val rulesEngine = RulesEngine()\\n    rulesEngine.executeRules(person)\\n    println(\"Can vote: ${person.canVote}\")\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThat\\'s it! You have now built a complete rules engine in Kotlin using the Drools open-source rule engine. You can customize the rules, model classes, and RulesEngine class to fit your specific requirements.', response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 480, 'prompt_tokens': 29, 'total_tokens': 509}, 'model_name': 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_3bc1b5746c', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None})"
